In statistics, population parameters are characteristics of an entire population, such as the mean, variance, or proportion, which may not be directly measurable due to practical constraints. Instead of trying to measure the parameter for the entire population, researchers often collect a sample from the population and use statistical methods to calculate a point estimate, which is a best guess at the true value of the parameter.\n",

It might be impractical to measure the height of every single male in the city, so you randomly select a sample of, say, 100 adult males and measure their heights. The average height of this sample can be considered a point estimate for the population's average height.\n",

        "Keep in mind that a point estimate is just a single value, and it's subject to variability due to sampling randomness.
