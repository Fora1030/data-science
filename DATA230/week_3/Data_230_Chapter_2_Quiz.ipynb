Look closely at the questions at the end of the chapter and then look at the solutions provided in the appendix. When you are ready, work through this notebook to answer these quiz questions. Once you are satisfied with your answers, go to the classroom to submit your answers. You have two attempts, so if you miss a question, come back here to work out another answer."
